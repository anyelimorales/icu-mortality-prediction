# 🩺 ICU Mortality Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting patient mortality in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) using clinical data. The project leverages data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling techniques to provide an early mortality risk assessment.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Statistical summaries, visualizations, and correlation analysis.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of multiple algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix.
- **Interpretability**: Feature importance analysis to understand model decisions.

## 🛠️ Installation
